## What is this?
I'm trying to apply flux pattern with React.js and solve these problems:

1. **Routing** : Every application have diferents routes. Ex.: `/about`, `/login`, `users/:id`,...
2. **API connexion** : Connect front end app with a REST api in the backend.
3. **Authentication** : Manage private views in the front end with Flux + React.
3. **I18n** : Mannage app translation and dates localization.
4. **packaging** : Find a way to make independent load of custom parts in the application `Custom Apps`.
4. **testing** : Find the best way to test a Flux + React powered app. Facebook has something. Investigate.
